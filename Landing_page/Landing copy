Hear From Our Patients (Testimonials)
I didn’t have to wait weeks to see a doctor. StatWellMD got me treated in under 15 minutes.
It was that simple!
– Emma, 28

Managing my skin and GLP-1 weight loss prescriptions from my phone is a game changer.
— Sofia, 31

I used to put off getting help because I was embarrassed to talk to anyone about my UTI. I tried
StatWellMD out of desperation and they made it simple. The doctor reviewed my form and
prescribed what I needed almost immediately. This is the best I’ve felt in weeks and it’s such a
relief to handle something like this privately.
— James, 34

Ordering birth control online felt scary at first, but the process was fast and professional.
— Mia R

Before StatWellMD, I’d spent months jumping between skincare products and online advice yet
no real change. I found StatWellMD on a friend’s recommendation, filled out the form, and got a
treatment plan the same day. Two weeks later, my skin is clearer and I finally feel like myself
again.
— Jasmine, 27
